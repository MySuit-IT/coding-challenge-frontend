# 💻 My.Suit Front End Coding Challenge 🖥️

## Introduction 👋

Thank you for your interest in My.Suit! We are a fast-growing company and are looking for someone with the drive and skills to help us grow. One of the most important skills that we ask candidates to have is expertise in React.js. Therefore, this challenge will be centered around React.js, but it should also give us a good indication of your skills in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## The Challenege 🏁

You have been provided with a starter React.js project with a homepage. Your tasks are as follows:

1. The `Orders` page can be found in the navbar, however, there is no functionality to it. Create the `Orders` page that includes a table that pulls orders from `orders.json` and displays the order information how you see fit. Style it however you think is best, but try to keep the overall theme.

2. You will notice a `Dark Mode` button on the top right-hand corner of the homepage. This button has no functionality, so you are tasked with creating a dark mode for the project. When I click the button, the theme of the entire website should change to dark mode. When I press it again, it should revert to light mode. The dark mode styling is up to you.

This project is meant to give you some creative freedom so we can evaluate not only your coding skills, but also your design skills.

## Bonus Points ⚠️

You have a chance to earn bonus points if you:

1. use any new features that recently came out with React 18.

and/or

2. use TypeScript.
